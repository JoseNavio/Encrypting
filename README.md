# Encryption Exercises

## Security

Here we aim to simulate user registration and authentication similar to any application, but with use a file as the database.

We'll register a user and persist their data into a file, which'll be encrypted for later use.


## Symmetric Encryption

Generate phrases or secret keys based on the chosen options.

Options:
- 3DES
- DES 
- AES 


## Asymmetric Encryption

We'll input a phrase, encrypt it, display the encrypted result, save the encrypted key in a file, and then decrypt it to reveal the original phrase.
Uses RSA algorithm.
